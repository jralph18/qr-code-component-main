## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Semantic use of the article tag. 

Quoting from the official HTML standard:

The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication.

### Useful resources

- [Semantic HTML Articles](https://www.codeguage.com/v1/courses/html/semantic-html-articles) - This helped me understand semantic use of the article tag.
